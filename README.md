# AI_assist

Hello guys this my first project about Python and this  is the AI Assistance which is nearly the same as Siri from Iphone or Google Assistance from Android.

The main file to run this project is " a.py "

And remember to install all needed libraries before running this project if don't, you will get some annoying errors.

I will give a list of libraries and the syntax to install them in a file "Library_Install".

Hope you'll enjoy. And if having any problems just send me an email, i will answer as soon as possible
